1.Machine Learning:-It is a field of study that gives computers that ability to do learn without being explicitly programmed.

2.ML Formal Defn:-  A computer program is said to-
				learn from experience E with respect to some class of task T and performance measure P 
				if its performance at task T as measured by P,improves with experience E.
3.Required Plugins:-

	1. numpy
	2. matplotlib
	3. pandas
	4. scipy 
	5. sci-kitlearn
	6. sklearn
	7. pillow
	8. seaborn
4.Steps involved in building a ML Application :-

	1. Collect DATA.
	2. Prepare the input DATA - cleanse,format etc.
	3. Annalyze the DATA - plotting, finding features etc.
	4. Train the Algorithm - run the designed algorithm on training data(not for unsupervised learning).
	5. Test the Algorithm - see to what extent it works on the test data.
	6. Use it - If the test is successful, use it with newfor which we are trying to find the answer.
